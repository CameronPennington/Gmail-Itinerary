# Gmail-Itinerary
This is one of the first scripts I wrote, so it might need work. It uses Google Apps Script to access your calendar, paste all events in a given time range into a spreadsheet, and then convert that spreadsheet into an HTML email that can be sent through Gmail.  It requires the SheetConverter library.
